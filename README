This subdir contains an non-official library to access CPL modules via
Python. It is not meant as part of the MUSE pipeline software, but may be
useful for testing.

Installation
============

1. Check requirements:
   - Python 2.6 or later
   - pyfits

2. Determine where to put the compiled python package. Standard for
   compilations is /usr/local.

3. In this directory, run 

   python setup.py install --prefix=<PREFIX>

   where the prefix determines the path for the compiled package. The package 
   will be installed in the subdir lib/python2.6/site-packages 
   (lib64/python2.6/site-packages on 64 bit systems) of <PREFIX>

4. Add the directory <PREFIX>/lib[64]/python2.6/site-packages to your 
   environment variable PYTHONPATH.
